                <h2>What's new?</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a rewrite of the original Battlescribe to TTS mod (with which I am not affiliated at all), 
                    all credit for inspiration and the code for drawing measuring circles around models goes to thehivemind5.
                    I have made some changes in this version to make life a bit easier for myself (and hopefully others as well):
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Datasheet attached to the unit has been cleaned up and hopefully looks a bit better now</li>
                        <li>I have added a Crusade Card attached to each unit where you can keep track of crusade statistics (press scripting key 9 while hovering a model)</li>
                        <li>I have added an easy way to keep track of agenda tallies (explained in "How To")</li>
                        <li>Changing wounds up and down is now more colorful!</li>
                        <li>For models with changing characteristics based on wounds (brackets), the description of the model will now display whatever its current statistics are (instead of just *s)</li>
                        <li>Army creation should be a little more organized and allows for the editing of unit names as well as assigning weapons that were not assigned properly (should fix some issues in the original where models wouldnt have weapons)</li>
                        <li>Finally, the spawning of an army in the in-game mod should now be much much faster</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                This website is made to be used with the in-game mod found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2536025249" target="_blank">HERE</a>. If you are familiar with the original Battlescribe2TTs,
                getting your army roster into TTS will be mostly similar. 
                If you are not familiar with that process, please follow the steps below (explained in further detail later on).
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create an army roster using Battlescribe and export the roster either by saving it (on a PC)
                    or by exporting as a Battlescribe Roster file (on mobile). In either case, the exported file
                    should be a .rosz file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upload your saved roster file to this website using "Upload" in the menu bar to the left. 
                    The uploaded roster will be stored for about 10 minutes after you finish editing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Edit the roster as you see fit (this will usually involve assigning unassigned weapons or changing custom names).
                    There are also some settings you can change in the menu bar. Then click Submit all the way at the bottom of the roster list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Copy the code that your are given on this site after uploading your roster, 
                    and paste it into the box in the in-game mod (found 
                    <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2536025249" target="_blank">HERE</a>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Choose models that you want to use for each model type in each unit.

                        NOTE: you can assign a model to multiple different model cards at a time
                        by selecting multiple model cards before selecting a model.

                <h3>Editing Your Roster</h3>
                <p>
                    There are a few ways to edit the models and units in your roster:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            You can set a custom name for the unit. This will apply the custom name given
                            to the model in a unit if it is a single-model unit (eg a character or vehicle),
                            or to every model in the unit if the appropriate setting is selected in the settings menu.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                You can assign or unassign weapons to models in the unit if they have unassigned weapons.
                                <b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> not all units have unassigned weapons. This <b>only</b> happens when Yellowscribe
                                can't tell which model or models should have a given weapon in the Battlescribe Data
                                (this can happen for a variety of reasons).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To assign a weapon to a model group, there will be some buttons in the "Unassigned Weapons"
                                section on that model group. There can be up to three buttons that show up (depending on the number of 
                                models in the group): 
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>a button with the name of the weapon. This assigns the weapon to a single model in the group</li>
                                <li>an "All" button. This assigns the weapon to every model in the group</li>
                                <li>a "Unit" button. This assigns the weapon to every model in the unit</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There are several options in the settings menu that should be self-explanatory.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>Associating Models</h3>
                <p>
                    To Associate a model with a model card, simply click on the model card (or model cards) 
                    with which you want to associate the model (or models). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can assign a model (or models) to multiple model cards by selecting multiple model 
                    cards before picking up any models; the subsequent model or models you pick up will be 
                    assigned to all the selected model cards at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can assign multiple models to a model card (or cards) by picking up multiple models at once.
                    When you assign multiple models to a model card, it will randomly select which model to use for each 
                    model in that model group from the assigned models.
                </p>

            <section class="scriptingSection">
                <h2>Scripting</h2>
                <p>
                    Several scripts are attached to your units when they are created with this tool.
                    Several of them are the same as the original Battlescribe2TTS, but a few of them are new (or have changed slightly).
                    The sections below will describe what happens when a particular scripting button is pressed.
                    The numbering refers to the <b>scripting button number</b> pressed, <b>not</b> necessarily a particular key (depending on your keybindings).
                    To see what key your scripting buttons are assigned to, or to change your keybindings, go to the
                    Configuration menu in TTS, go to controls, then scroll down to the Scripting Button section.
                </p>
                <h3>Scripting Button 1</h3>
                <p>
                    This will show a datasheet for the unit just like it did in the original mod. 
                    However, the data within it has been reorganized and should (hopefully) look a bit nicer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also highlight your units with the buttons that run along the bottom edge of the datasheet.
                    To remove the highlight, click the grey button at the end of the row.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, when you highlight a unit, any measuring circles added to it (see 4 and 5 below) will be
                    in the highlighted color and <b>will not</b> overwrite previous measuring circles in other colors.
                    This allows you to have multiple measuring circles on a model at a time.
                </p>
                <h3>Scripting Button 2 or 3</h3>
                <p>
                    This will either remove (2) or add (3) a wound to the model you are hovering over. 
                    This should work exactly the same as the original mod with the following differences:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The model's wounds should be helpfully colored according to how damaged it is 
                        (green when fully healthy, red when almost dead, yellow somewhere in between)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the model has characteristics that change based on how many wounds it has, 
                        these characteristics will change in its description based on its current wounds
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Scripting Button 4 or 5</h3>
                <p>
                    Expands (4) or shrinks (5) a measuring circle around the model over which you are hovering. 
                    A bonus feature has been added in this new version: a model can have multiple measuring rings around it at once.
                    When a model is highlighted, it will produce a measuring ring in that color while also retaining any rings 
                    it had in other highlight colors (or in pink if it measured without a highlight).
                </p>
                <h3>Scripting Button 6 and 7</h3>
                <p>These do exactly what they did in the original version: switch which measuring ring is used for the model.</p>
                <h3>Scripting Button 8</h3>
                <p>This toggles whether or not the measuring ring should be rectangular for the model.</p>
                <h3>Scripting Button 9</h3>
                <p>
                    If Crusade Scripting is included (see the settings menu when editing your roster), 
                    this shows the unit's crusade card. The card is shared by all the models in the unit 
                    and should hopefully be useable as a way to track your units within TTS.
                </p>
                <h3>Scripting Button 10</h3>
                <p>
                    If Crusade Scripting is included (see the settings menu when editing your roster), 
                    this shows the unit's agenda tally card. To use it, you must have an Agenda Manager 
                    spawned into the game and set up. The Agenda Manager is availible in the in-game mod 
                    on the top right corner of the table, simply save it and spawn it into whatever game you want to use it in.
                    Details on how to use the Agenda Manager can be found below.
                </p>
                <h3>Right-click Menu</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently there is only one function in a unit's right-click menu, but I may add more in the future, 
                    keep a look out! 
                </p>
                <h4>Toggle Coherency check</h4>
                <p>
                    This turns on coherency checking for the unit until it is turned off again the same way.
                    While checking coherency, any models in the unit that are out of coherency with other models will be
                    highlighted red. If all the models in the unit are in coherency (other than models that are out of coherency),
                    they will be highlighted green. If there are multiple (i.e. more than one) groups of models that are in 
                    coherency with each other, but not with other groups, all such groups will be highlighted yellow.
                    <br /><br />
                    Any face-down models in the unit will be completely ignored for the purposes of coherency checking. 
                    Coherency checking will automatically determine whether the unit has 6 or more models (and thus requires two models
                    in coherency for each model), and should also handle vertical coherency checking fairly well (though I can't guarantee 
                    that vertical checking is completely accurate).
                    <br /><br />
                    Coherency checking for models with oval bases is currently mostly imprecise (though itll do an ok job).
                    There is no particularly reasonable way of making it more precise.

                <h2>Agenda Manager</h2>
                <p>
                    The Agenda Manager is meant to help you keep track of agenda tallies (via spripting button 10 on your units), 
                    as well as provide a helpful display to help you remember which agendas you selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To use the Agenda Manager, first make sure to save the object (the little tile with a button on it at the top
                    left of the table in the in-game mod). Once you're in a game and getting set up for a battle,
                    spawn in your Agenda Manager and follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Click the "Associate Models" button on the Agenda Manager.
                            This tells the Agenda Manager that you have started associating models (and units) with it so that it
                            keeps track of agendas for those units.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the Agenda Manager is in this "associating models" mode, any object you pick up will be associated with
                            the Agenda Manager. When a model is associated with the Agenda Manager, it will be highlighted in green
                            until you finish associating models. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note: you do NOT need to pick up the models you want to associate with it all at once,
                            you can do them in batches, one at a time, all at once, it doesn't really matter.
                            The Agenda Manager will keep associating models with itself until you click the "Finish" button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you accidentally pick up some object that isn't one of the models that you want
                            to associate with it, it's OK: associating an object with the Agenda Manager only does something if that
                            object is capable of showing a tally card (scripting button 10 on your units).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Click the "Finish" button to stop associating models</li>
                    <li>Select the battle size you are playing</li>
                    <li>Fill out the agendas you have selected</li>
                    <li>
                        Click the "Accept" button to lock in your agendas,
                        And now you should be able to see your agenda tallies when you hit scripting button 10 on your units!
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Please make sure you have your rosz file handy as I will need it to try and replicate whatever
                issue is giving your trouble. If I don't have your rosz file, it will be much much harder for
                me to fix the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have your rosz file ready, or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to come

                make sure you do so in #report-here and include the rosz file. (If you don't include your rosz file in the
                bug report, I will invariably ask you for it anyway).
